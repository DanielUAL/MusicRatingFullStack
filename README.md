# MusicRatingFullStack
This project, developed using React, Express, and PostgreSQL, serves as a platform where users can create group chats with friends to share and rate music. Made use of an agile workflow to complete the project as a group of two. This project was originally hosted with AWS EC2.

Participants in a group can send songs, and all members become graders until the song is fully rated. The platform includes an archive that displays all rated songs, along with their ratings and the original sender's information. People are able to make an account, and have their specific group chats show up in the home screen upon logging in. Clicking a different group chat will also auto update the home screen accordingly.
